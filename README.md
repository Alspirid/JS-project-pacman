#JS-project-Packman

### Background and overview
Packman is a well known arcade video game from 1980 originally created by Namco in Japan. The game represents a game board, with a maze.
There are main character Packman and several enemies also known as "monsters" or "ghosts" moving inside the maze. 
The goal of the game is to accumulate points by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze, completing that 'stage' of the game and starting the next stage and maze of Pac-dots.
The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game is over.
